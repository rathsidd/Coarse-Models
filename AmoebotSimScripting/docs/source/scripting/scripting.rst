Scripting
=========

This scripting reference is for researchers ðŸ§ª and developers ðŸ’» learning how to write custom JavaScript experiments for AmoebotSim.

Instead of simply using the user interface controls to run a single algorithm instance, AmoebotSim also exposes a JavaScript interface that enables more programmatic and granular control of the simulator.
The scripting interface can be used to run large numbers of algorithm instances automatically and consecutively, adjust algorithm parameters more fluidly, capture metrics data for repeated runs, and lower runtime by streamlining graphics.


Writing Scripts
---------------

Writing custom JavaScript experiments for AmoebotSim uses standard JavaScript syntax, while additionally making use of custom commands specific to AmoebotSim (listed below in the :ref:`JavaScript API <script-api>`).
Here is an example of a simple JavaScript experiment:

.. code-block:: javascript

  for (var run = 0; run < 25; run++) {
    shapeformation(100, 0.2, "h");
    runUntilTermination();
    writeToFile('shapeformation_data.txt', getMetric("# Rounds") + '\n');
  }

In the above script, AmoebotSim runs 25 instances of the **Basic Shape Formation** algorithm (with given parameters), appending the value of the "# Rounds" metric at the end of each run to a text file.
This data could then be used, for example, to compute average runtime.

The simple scripting above can be expanded to carry out much more complex experiments.


Running Scripts
---------------

To run your JavaScript experiment, press the *Run Script* button in the sidebar and select the desired JavaScript file.
AmoebotSim will then begin executing your script, temporarily disabling graphics updates for faster execution.
When the script execution completes, graphics are reenabled and the following message will be logged to the simulator: ``Ran script: path_to_file/your_script.js``.

.. warning::
  All JavaScript experiment files must be saved within the directory containing AmoebotSim's executable.
  Otherwise, AmoebotSim's JavaScript engine will not be able to locate or execute the script.

.. note::
  AmoebotSim may temporarily hang (i.e., "Not Responding" on Windows or the faded window and rainbow pinwheel on macOS) while the script is executing.
  This is expected behavior, and is simply acknowledging that graphics are not currently being updating.

The following animation illustrates the process of loading and running a script in AmoebotSim:
