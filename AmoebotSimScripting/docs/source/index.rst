AmoebotSim
==========

Welcome to `AmoebotSim <https://github.com/SOPSLab/AmoebotSim>`_, a visual simulator for the amoebot model developed by the `Self-Organizing Particle Systems (SOPS) Lab <https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/>`_ at Arizona State University and the University of Paderborn.
The `amoebot model <https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/sops/amoebot/>`_ is an abstraction of *programmable matter*, a material that can dynamically change its physical properties (e.g., shape, size, color, etc.) based on user input or stimuli from its environment.
This simulator is designed for students and researchers who want to:

* Visualize and learn about current distributed algorithms for the amoebot model
* Experiment with new ideas for amoebot model algorithms
* Validate correctness and runtime claims for new or existing amoebot model algorithms


Getting Started
---------------

In your self-guided tour through our documentation, choosing the right guide for your goals will get you to the right information quickly.


Explorer ðŸ”Ž
^^^^^^^^^^^

You're an *explorer* if:

* You'd just like to see some particle systems in action.
* You don't necessarily have a lot of programming experience.
* You're looking for a first step into programmable matter research.
* You want the fastest path to experimenting with existing algorithms.

If this describes you, refer to the :ref:`Installation Guide <install-explorer>` for instructions on downloading the most recent standalone version of AmoebotSim.
Then, follow the :doc:`Usage Guide <usage/usage>` for instructions on navigating the AmoebotSim environment.


Researcher ðŸ§ª
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You're a *researcher* if:

* You want to implement your own algorithm ideas in AmoebotSim.
* You want evidence that an amoebot model algorithm you're developing does not have missing cases or bugs.
* You're preparing a paper on an amoebot model algorithm and want to add simulation results and performance statistics.

If this describes you, refer to the :ref:`Installation Guide <install-researchdev>` for instructions on cloning the most recent stable codebase, installing the development environment, and running the project.
Then, refer to the :doc:`Code Tutorials <tutorials/tutorials>` for a walkthrough of AmoebotSim algorithms and examples and the :doc:`Scripting Documentation <scripting/scripting>` for a guide to scripting experiments.


Developer ðŸ’»
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You're a *developer* if:

* You're a researcher (as above) who wants to add your algorithms to the public, canonical version of AmoebotSim.
* You're interested in contributing to and maintaining AmoebotSim as an open source project.
* You're a member of the SOPS Lab on the AmoebotSim team.

If this describes you, refer to the :ref:`Installation Guide <install-researchdev>` for instructions on cloning the most recent stable codebase, installing the development environment, and running the project.
If you're new to AmoebotSim development, refer to the :doc:`Code Tutorials <tutorials/tutorials>` for a walkthrough of AmoebotSim algorithms and examples and the :doc:`Scripting Documentation <scripting/scripting>` for a guide to scripting experiments.
All development best practices and guidelines for contributions are discussed under :doc:`Development <development/development>`.

.. tip::
  Look for the ðŸ”Ž, ðŸ§ª, and ðŸ’» guides throughout the documentation to find the information most relevant to you.
