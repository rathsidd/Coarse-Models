We're glad you want to add a simulation of your algorithm to AmoebotSim, and we hope that AmoebotSim has been useful to you in visualizing your algorithm as you developed it. Please fill out the following sections as completely as possible to help us make an assessment of whether or not to include your simulation in the canonical version of AmoebotSim.

**What does this algorithm do?**
A concise description of the algorithm's behavior.

**Is this algorithm published?**
Yes/No. If it is published, include a link to the paper describing your algorithm, as well as a link to an arXiv version if you have one.

**Can you vouch for the correctness of the simulation?**
Yes/No. It will be very time-intensive for us to read and understand the details of your paper and then verify the correctness of the corresponding simulation. By saying "Yes", you assume responsibility for your code's correctness.

**Are you willing to maintain this algorithm going forward?**
Yes/No. Every algorithm added is code that we will have to maintain and keep updated. This takes a lot of effort. By saying "Yes", you agree to help maintain your algorithm moving forward.
