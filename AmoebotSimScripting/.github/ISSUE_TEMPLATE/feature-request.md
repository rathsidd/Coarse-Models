A clear and concise description of what new feature or functionality you would like. Feel free to add any screenshots, code snippets, or other supporting information to help us assess your request.

**Labels**
Please add one of "diff-easy", "diff-medium", or "diff-hard" based on your assessment of how difficult this feature would be to implement and maintain. (Please delete this section after adding the label).

**Can you help develop and maintain this feature?**
Yes/No. Every feature we add is code that we will have to maintain and keep updated. This takes a lot of effort. Your answer helps us take the amount of effort required by our team into account when deciding whether to implement this feature.
